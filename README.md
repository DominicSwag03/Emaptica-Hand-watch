# Emaptica-Hand-watch

This Python script is designed to synchronize and merge all biophysical data outputs from the Empatica E4 device into a single file. The Empatica E4 is a wrist-worn device that continuously measures various biophysical responses, including Heart Rate (HR), Inter-Beat Interval (IBI), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), skin temperature, and 3-axis acceleration. These responses are recorded at different frequencies, such as HR at 4 Hz and BVP at 64 Hz.

The script processes these responses by downsampling them to a common frequency of 1 Hz (the same as the HR rate). This downsampling involves aggregating values over one-second intervals, then averaging those totals according to their respective frequencies. For the acceleration data, a low-pass filter is applied to eliminate the effects of gravity, allowing for the calculation of an overall (total acceleration) value. The IBI values, which are timestamps marking each heartbeat, are first encoded into a new variable so they can be matched with the regularly sampled variables (like HR). Consequently, the IBI output generated by this script represents the total IBI during each one-second interval.

To run the script, simply place it in the folder containing the Empatica data files and execute it. The script will combine all the data into a single output CSV file.
